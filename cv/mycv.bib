  abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate patients
	who underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy for "acalculus" cholangitis
	associated with juxtapapillary diverticula. METHODOLOGY: In a retrospective
	study we analyzed 87 patients who underwent endoscopic sphincterotomy
	for cholangitis; the cholangitis considered "acalculus", when outlining
	the extra- and intrahepatic bile ducts, we could not observe any
	intraluminal defect or stricture, and during the clearing of the
	bile ducts with the balloon, after endoscopic sphincterotomy, there
	was no evidence of stones, fragments of stones or sludge. Patients
	who had undergone previous endoscopic sphincterotomy, or who had
	additional pancreatobiliary diseases were excluded from this study.
	There were 11 patients with "acalculus" cholangitis associated with
	juxtapapillary diverticula, and sufficient clinical data available
	for this study. RESULTS: Nine patients presented pain, fever, and
	jaundice. In two patients diagnosis was established via the test
	of abnormal liver biochemistry. Seven patients had positive blood
	cultures and three of them developed confusion and hypotension. Endoscopic
	sphincterotomy succeeded in all cases; no evidence of stones, fragments
	of stones or sludge was recorded during the clearing of bile ducts,
	after endoscopic sphincterotomy, with the balloon. Five patients
	presented mild post-endoscopic sphincterotomy complications successfully
	treated. In the follow-up period, from 4 months to 7 years after
	endoscopic sphincterotomy, none of the patients developed symptoms
	of cholangitis. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend endoscopic sphincterotomy
	in patients with "acalculus" cholangitis associated with juxtapapillary
	diverticula, despite the absence of obvious obstruction, and the
	possible morbidity which is inherent with an invasive procedure like
	endoscopic sphincterotomy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endoscopic biliary stenting is often used for large or
	difficult common bile duct (CBD) stones, but the effect of indwelling
	endoprosthesis on size or fragmentation of stones after long-term
	treatment with biliary stenting has not been formally established.
	We compared the stone size or fragmentation of common bile duct stones
	after a long period of biliary stenting. METHODS: Endoscopic biliary
	endoprosthesis was performed for 49 high-risk patients with CBD stones
	too large or difficult to be extracted by conventional endoscopic
	means. Bile duct drainage was established in all the patients without
	complications. Of the patients, 24 died with endoprosthesis in situ
	all from causes unrelated to biliar disease; 22 underwent a second
	and three patients a third attempt at stone extraction. The largest
	stone diameter was >12 mm in all patients. RESULTS: In 11 of 25 patients
	(44\%) the endoprosthesis allowed resolution of the problem of unextractable
	common bile duct stones. Four patients showed no existence of stent,
	and ERCP complete stone clearance from the CBD on programmized appointment
	after endoprosthesis insertion. Reduced size or fragmentation of
	stones was obtained in seven patients, and the stones could be removed
	endoscopically. The remaining 14 patients demonstrated no significant
	change in the size or fragmentation of their stones, and endoprostheses
	were replaced. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that endoscopic
	endoprosthesis for large or difficult CBD stones is an effective
	method to clear the duct in selected cases, as well as an important
	definitive treatment in high-risk patients.},
